# Gomoku AI Using Neural Networks
*This mini repository is a fork of deepseasw's [OmokQLearning](https://github.com/deepseasw/OmokQLearning), modifying the code to run under Python 3 and TensorFlow 2. Please do check out the original.*<br/>
<br/>
First run `python GomokuTrain.py` to train the neural network. Training will automatically stop after 5 iterations, or 500 epochs.<br/>
Then run `python GomokuPlay.py` to see the AI play against itself.<br/>
Don't ask me how it works. I have no clue.<br/>
